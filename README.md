# Network Configuration Manuals Repository

Welcome to this repository containing a collection of detailed network configuration manuals designed for Cisco Packet Tracer simulations. These manuals cover a variety of advanced networking topics including VLAN segmentation, dynamic routing protocols such as EIGRP and BGP, WAN connections, firewall security, DHCP setup, Telnet remote administration, and DMZ configurations.

## Overview

The manuals provide step-by-step guides for setting up complex network topologies involving multiple routers, switches, and PCs. Each guide focuses on practical implementation of core networking concepts, such as:

- Configuring and managing VLANs and inter-VLAN routing
- Establishing WAN links between routers and simulating ISP connections
- Implementing enhanced interior gateway routing protocols (EIGRP)
- Configuring external gateway routing with Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
- Setting up security measures using firewalls and access control lists (ACLs)
- Automating IP address assignment using DHCP servers
- Enabling remote network management through Telnet
- Creating DMZ zones with dedicated services like DNS, FTP, and Web servers

These resources are ideal for networking students and professionals who want to deepen their understanding of real-world network design and troubleshooting in a simulated environment.
